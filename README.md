## Summary
This is a mini app was created for initially exploring socket.IO. And what better way to explore sockets than creating a basic chat app? Tests were done using Jest and Enyzme as the app progressed.

There is no database in the backend so sessions are non-persistent. Upon reload, users will be redirected back to the join page to sign in. To be possibly added later if lacking a database is to store user info on sessionStorage... maybe.
